<p>🎓 I'm in my third year of studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at Monash University, majoring in Cybersecurity. I’ve developed a growing passion for ethical hacking, system hardening, and secure web development — especially as digital threats continue to evolve.</p>

<p>🔐 Through both coursework and self-driven projects, I’ve been able to apply security concepts in practical environments — from attacking and defending vulnerable systems to building safer web applications. I’m motivated by the idea of making real-world digital systems more secure and accessible for everyone.</p>

<h2>💼 Cybersecurity Projects & Coursework</h2>

- <b>🧪 Applied Cryptography</b>  
  Worked with encryption algorithms, hashing functions, and secure communication protocols. Developed sample applications demonstrating how cryptographic concepts protect data in transit and at rest.

- <b>💻 System Exploitation: Buffer Overflow & Format Strings</b>  
  Gained hands-on experience exploiting memory-based vulnerabilities within a Linux environment. 

- <b>🌐 Web Vulnerability Testing (SQLi, XSS, CSRF)</b>  
  Exploited common web vulnerabilities in a safe lab environment. Gained a strong understanding of how malicious payloads can manipulate front-end and back-end logic, and how to defend against them.

- <b>🔍 Penetration Testing & Threat Modelling</b>  
  Conducted penetration tests on simulated systems and built threat models to assess system risks. 

- <b>🕸️ Secure Web Development with CakePHP</b>  
  Contributed to the development and security testing of CakePHP-based web applications. Identified weaknesses through manual and basic automated testing to improve site resilience.

<h2>🌱 Current Focus Areas</h2>

- Learning how to properly approach penetration testing — not just running tools, but really understanding what’s happening
- Building a strong foundation through platforms like TryHackMe and PortSwigger
- Exploring secure coding practices and how to actually make applications harder to exploit
- Starting to dip into cloud security 
- Trying to connect what I learn to real-world risks — understanding how vulnerabilities impact people and systems, and how to fix them responsibly
